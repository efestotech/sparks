Features of the Forge
=====================

SPARKS is not a simple sending system; it is a work of mythological engineering.

Multiple SMTP Management (The Anvils)
-------------------------------------

* **Intelligent Rotation**: The system rotates through different SMTP servers to maximize delivery and respect limits.
* **Hourly and Daily Limits**: Each "Anvil" has its own configurable limits to avoid bans and overloads.
* **Connection Pooling**: The system keeps connections active to speed up the sending of large quantities of sparks.
* **Personal Sender Identity**: Each server can have its own sender name and email.

Sending Queue (The Hearth)
--------------------------

* **Priority Management**: Sends critical messages before standard notifications.
* **Automatic Retries**: If a sent fails, the system retries according to the configuration (default: 3 retries).
* **Detailed Logging**: Every event is recorded with the original SMTP error codes for rapid debugging.

Administrative Interface (The Citadel)
---------------------------------------

* **Premium Design**: An interface inspired by Greek mythology, elegant and modern.
* **Native Multilingual**: Full support for Italian and English, with automatic language detection.
* **Real-time Dashboard**: View the status of embers and anvils at a glance.
* **Guardian Management**: Manage different administrative accounts with individual API keys.

Aegis Security
--------------

* **Password Encryption**: SMTP passwords are encrypted in the database using AES-256.
* **Worker Security**: Worker execution is protected by a configurable Secret Sigil (Secret Key).
* **API Isolation**: External access is only allowed through regenerable API keys.
